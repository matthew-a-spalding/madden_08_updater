This is the top level folder (manually created, not as a part of an automated python project) 
for my test of scripting Scrapy, instead of running it from the command line.

The files and folders are all manually added (by using right click -> New... for folders and files) 
and the contents of the files were determined from the following sources:

  1) https://github.com/scrapinghub/testspiders 
	(The Git repo of "Useful test spiders for Scrapy")
  2) http://doc.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/practices.html 
	(Scrapy docs; Common Practices; Run Scrapy from a script)
  3) http://blog.tryolabs.com/2011/09/27/calling-scrapy-python-script/
