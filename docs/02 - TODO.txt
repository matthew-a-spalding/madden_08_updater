- Find the formula used in the Madden Amp source to calculate the breakdown of a player's salary into the individual years.
	
	***	There is just a numeric formula, and it relies upon PTSA (Total Salary), PVSB (Signing Bonus), PCON (Contract Length), 
		and PCYL (Contract Years Left). Don't need to worry about it. Just set those fields and let the game figure out the breakdown.
	
- Check on the PVTS field (col CV). See if it always matches the value in PTSA.
	
	***	It does. At least in the default roster.	***
	
- Find out what the other values of Player Role (PROL and PRL2) mean.
	
	***	Done.	***
	
- Fill out the lists of other field values using in-game examples.
	
	***	Done.	***
	
- List all of the fields that I will be setting from the PLAY table in the 'Methods for Setting Field Values' Excel file, and give descriptions 
	of how I intend to set the value for the field. Descriptions can be sentences, mathematical formulae, or pseudo-code.
	
	***	Done.	***
	
- Finish writing the Scrapy script that will create "NFL and FBG.csv" for use in the final "MaddenUpdater.py" script.
	
	***	In progress.	***
	
- Make a Git repo of the code, and keep old backups in a separate folder, with new backups being made only once in a while off a revision from Git.

	***	TODO	***

- Test the import of "NFL and FBG.csv" alongside "Madden Ratings.csv"; write a simple script that uses both in formulating the values to put into a 
player's fields.
	- Use the Bears, and work out the matching of player names between the Madden and NFL/FBG ratings files.
	
	***	TODO	***
	
- Write the rest of "MaddenUpdater.py" according to the outline in "Methods for Setting Field Values.xlsx". Separate out each position into its own 
Python module.
	
	***	TODO	***
