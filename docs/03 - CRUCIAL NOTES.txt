- When editing an existing player into a new one, you MUST update both the PPOS (Player Position ID) AND POPS (Player Other Positions ID), or else 
the mis-match could cause problems when editing that player in-game. For example, making a WR out of a ROLB without updating his POPS would mean that 
in the in-game player editer, he will automatically become a DT or something similar, and WR will NOT be an option.
