To setup the necessary environment for running the Python code against Scrapy:

NOTE: After seeing the list of requirements for scrapy from a 'pip install scrapy' AFTER it had been installed, it appears that 
you should not need to manually pip install the prerequisite packages 'lxml' and 'pyOpenSSL' before installing scrapy, as they are 
packages that pip can install on its own. However, pywin32 is NOT pip-installable, so the short version for installing Scrapy may 
just be: 1) Install Python 2.7.x (latest), then 2) pywin32 for that version/bitness, then 3) just 'pip install scrapy'.

In case that doesn't seem to get all of the requirements, here is the long version of instructions, which are what I actually did:

1) Install a version of Python that Scrapy supports. Currently, it does not support 3.x, so try 2.7.x.
	
	- Go to: https://www.python.org/downloads/ .
	(As of the time of writing these setup notes, 2.7.10 was the latest available release.)
	
	- Make sure to have the python executable paths added to the system environment variable PATH.
	(In 2.7.10, it gives the option of having the installer do this, though it is not selected by deafult, so I selected it.)
	
	
2) Install the right pywin32 version (in this case, latest build (219), 32 bit, for python 2.7).
	
	- Check which bitness of python has been installed. Open the Python shell GUI (IDLE) and type:
		>>> import platform
		>>> platform.architecture()
	This should report:
		('32bit', 'WindowsPE')
	
	- Go to: http://sourceforge.net/projects/pywin32/files/pywin32/ .
	
	- Download and then install the right installer, in this case "pywin32-219.win32-py2.7.exe".
	
3) Install LXML.
	
	- In a command prompt, check that Python 2.7 correctly installed PIP along with it (no reason it shouldn't, but anyway...)
		
		C:\Users\spalding>pip --version
	
	Should report:
		pip [version] from C:\Python27\lib\site-packages (python 2.7)
	
	- In the same command prompt, type:
		
		C:\Users\spalding>pip install lxml
	
	It will install any prerequisites and then lxml.
	
	
4) Make sure OpenSSL is installed (should come with Python 2.7).
	
	In the same command prompt, type:
		C:\Users\spalding>pip list
	This should list all the packages installed in site-packages, including:
		...
		pyOpenSSL (0.15.1)
		...
	(Could also use the 'pip show <package>' command, like:
		C:\Users\spalding>pip show pyOpenSSL
	Which should give the list of info on that package, if installed.)
		
	
5) Finally, install Scrapy.
	
	In the same command prompt, type:
		C:\Users\spalding>pip install scrapy
	This should install scrapy and any requirements.
