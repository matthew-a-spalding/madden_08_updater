To setup the necessary environment for running my Python code against Scrapy:

1) Install a version of Python that Scrapy supports. Currently, it does not support 3.x, so try 
2.7.x.
    
    - Go to: https://www.python.org/downloads/ .
    (As of the time of writing these setup notes, 2.7.12 was the latest available release.)
    
    - Make sure to have the python executable paths added to the system environment variable PATH.
    (In 2.7.12, it gives the option of having the installer do this, though it is not selected by 
    deafult, so I selected it. I also unselected the option for Register Extensions, which would  
    have made 2.7.12 the default Python installation.)
    
    - Since I already had Python 3.5.2 installed and on the PATH, I needed to resolve the conflict 
    between the two versions. At first, I renamed the two EXEs from python.exe to python2.exe and 
    python3.exe, as well as removing two of the pip files from each installation's "Scripts" 
    directory, leaving only the files "pip2.exe" and "pip3.exe". However, this made both of the 
    pip versions not work right, as I suppose they look for the file "python.exe" in their parent 
    directory, and they could no longer find them. So, I renamed the files back to "python.exe", 
    and then I did two things to resolve the PATH conflict
    
        - First, I made symbolic links to the two "python.exe" files in a new folder I made, 
        "C:\python_links", by opening a command prompt WITH ADMIN PRIVS (NOT GitBash) and typing:
            C:\Users\spalding> cd C:\python_links
            C:\python_links> mklink python2.exe "C:\Program Files (x86)\Python2-7-12\python.exe"
            C:\python_links> mklink python3.exe "C:\Program Files (x86)\Python35-32\python.exe"
        
        - Then I removed "C:\Program Files (x86)\Python2-7-12\;" and 
        "C:\Program Files (x86)\Python35-32\;" from the System PATH, and added "C:\python_links\;".
    
    
2) Install the right pywin32 version (in this case, latest build (220), 32 bit, for python 2.7).
    
    - Check which bitness of python has been installed. Open the Python shell GUI (IDLE) and type:
        >>> import platform
        >>> platform.architecture()
    This should report:
        ('32bit', 'WindowsPE')
    
    - Go to: http://sourceforge.net/projects/pywin32/files/pywin32/ .
    
    - Download and then install the right installer, in this case "pywin32-220.win32-py2.7.exe".
    
3) Finally, install Scrapy.
    
    Open an ADMIN GitBash window and type:
        $ pip2 install scrapy
    This should have installed scrapy and any requirements. However, since things are shit, it 
    failed, with the error message: 
        error: Microsoft Visual C++ 9.0 is required (Unable to find vcvarsall.bat). Get it from 
        http://aka.ms/vcpython27
        
    So, I went to the site (which redirected me to an official Microsoft site) and downloaded and 
    installed the MS Visual C++ Compiler Package for Python 2.7. THEN, I tried the pip install of 
    scrapy again, and this time... it errored out. On lxml. Saying:
        ERROR: 'xslt-config' is not recognized as an internal or external command,
        operable program or batch file.
    
        ** make sure the development packages of libxml2 and libxslt are installed **
        
    SO, I tried:
        pip2 install lxml
        
    And this errored out the same way. SO... I googled the error "'xslt-config' is not recognized 
    as an internal or external command", and found a StackOverflow page telling me to go get a 
    wheel file (.whl) for installing lxml, found on the site of some dude named Christoph Gohlke. 
    Seemed a bit shady, but what the hey. I downloaded the file "lxml-3.6.4-cp27-cp27m-win32.whl" 
    and opened an ADMIN command prompt, cd'd to the downloads folder (C:\Users\spalding\Downloads), 
    and did:
        C:\Users\spalding\Downloads> pip2 install lxml-3.6.4-cp27-cp27m-win32.whl
        
    This seemed to work. ("...Successfully installed lxml-3.6.4"). SO now I again tried to:
        
        $ pip2 install scrapy
        
    in an ADMIN GitBash window, and... It seemed to work. However, I am still having all sorts of 
    problems running python2/python3 from the command line. I'm scrapping the current installs of 
    Python 2 AND Python 3, since they are both installed under "C:\Program Files (x86)", which is a 
    restricted location and causes problems with installations, etc. I'm going to delete them BOTH 
    and re-install them into:
        
        C:\Python2-7-12
        
        and
        
        C:\Python3-5-2
        
4) Ok. So, I deleted both versions of Python using the Add/Remove Programs links, and started the 
    re-install with Python 3.5.2. In the Setup wizard, I chose Customize Installation, then left 
    the boxes checked to include the Documentation, pip, tcl/tk & IDLE, Python test suite, and the 
    py launcher, for all users. In Advanced Options, I left "Associate files with Python" checked, 
    unchecked "Create shortcuts for installed applications", then also checked "Install for all 
    users" (which automatically checked "Precompile standard library") and "Add Python to 
    environment variables". Finally, I chose the new location (C:\Python3-5-2) and let her rip.
    
5) Now, on to Python 2.7.12. I created the new folder at C:\Python2-7-12 and ran the installer.
