If Scrapy stops working because my system Python on the machine is different from the one I used when I last re-
created the venv, I will need to recreate the venv (using the system Python, as always) and then pip install scrapy 
and pypiwin32 for it to work again.

First, delete the folder "e:\Gaming\madden_08_updater\venv" (or whatever drive letter the USB stick is).

Then, in a command prompt window, do:
    
    > python -m venv e:\Gaming\madden_08_updater\venv
    
    > e:
    
    > cd e:\Gaming\madden_08_updater\venv
    
    > .\Scripts\activate.bat
    
    > python -m pip install --upgrade pip
    
    > pip install Scrapy
    
    > pip install pypiwin32


That's it! Scrapy should now work per the instructions in "step_1 README for madden_08_updater.txt".
