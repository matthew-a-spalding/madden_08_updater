First, download the Visual C++ Compiler Package for Python 2.7 (even though I will be using Python 3.6.x) from: 
    https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=44266
This is a straightforward install. 

Next up is the MS Visual Build Tools, which has multiple versions. I think the important parts for Twisted are the 
Windows Software Development Kit and the actual Build Tools. Get the version "Build Tools for Visual Studio 2017" 
from https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/, under the "Tools for Visual Studio 2017" section below the fold. 
[The file was somewhat randomly named, but it was file version 15.7.27703.2042 (from Properties->Details). The older 
version which my laptop had installed was file version 15.6.27428.2037.] When installing this, simply select "Visual 
C++ Build Tools" under the Workloads tab, and leave the two Optional boxes checked in the Summary on the right.

Then, get a somewhat specific version of 32-bit Python installed, v 3.6.x (the latest maintenance release is 
3.6.6, which I installed even though the laptop got Scrapy working with 3.6.5). 

    MAKE SURE IT IS 32-BIT PYTHON! I think the 64-bit version may have been the main cause of previous failures.

After installing Python, in a command prompt window do:

    python -m venv C:\Home\madden_08_updater_venv
    
    cd C:\Home\madden_08_updater_venv
    
    .\Scripts\activate.bat
    
    python -m pip install --upgrade pip
    
    pip install Scrapy
    
    pip install pypiwin32
