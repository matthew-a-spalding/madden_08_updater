- Find the formula used in the Madden Amp source to calculate the breakdown of a player's salary 
into the individual years.

    ***	There is just a numeric formula, and it relies upon PTSA (Total Salary), PVSB 
    (Signing Bonus), PCON (Contract Length), and PCYL (Contract Years Left). Don't need to worry 
    about it. Just set those fields and let the game figure out the breakdown.

- Check on the PVTS field (col CV). See if it always matches the value in PTSA.

    ***	It does. At least in the default roster.	***

- Find out what the other values of Player Role (PROL and PRL2) mean.

    ***	Done.	***

- Fill out the lists of other field values using in-game examples.

    ***	Done.	***

- List all of the fields that I will be setting from the PLAY table in the 'Methods for Setting 
Field Values' Excel file, and give descriptions of how I intend to set the value for the field. 
Descriptions can be sentences, mathematical formulae, or pseudo-code.

    ***	Done.	***

- Make a Git repo of the code, and keep old backups in a separate folder, with new backups being 
made only once in a while off a revision from Git.

    ***	Done.	***

- Finish writing the Scrapy script that will create "NFL Rosters.csv" for use in the final 
"MaddenUpdater.py" script.

    ***	IN PROGRESS.
        
        Figure out:
            1) if I can currently scrape NFL.com to get the "NFL Rosters.csv" file made.
                - YES! I can make the file, without FBGratings input.
            2) if and how I can get one player's record updated so it will be usable in-game.
                - CONTINUE HERE
            3) what each individual Python file is currently doing and make a docstring about it.
            
        Then, re-work all the Python files to follow best practices, and move to the next item in 
        this list, testing the use of the two CSV files together.
        
    ***

- Test the import of "NFL Rosters.csv" alongside "Madden Ratings.csv"; write a simple script that 
uses both in formulating the values to put into a player's fields. Use the Bears, and work out the 
matching of player names between the Madden and NFL files.

    ***	TODO	***

- Write the rest of "MaddenUpdater.py" according to the outline in "Methods for Setting Field 
Values.xlsx". Separate out each position into its own Python module.

    ***	TODO	***
